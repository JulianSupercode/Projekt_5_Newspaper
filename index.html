          <h3>Shattering cookware</h3>
          <p>
            More than 37,000 people were injured from using cookware. Hot
            handles can burn and sometimes glass cookware can shatter.
          </p>

          <h3>Knife cuts</h3>
          <p>
            Lacerations caused by knives of all kinds (not just the kitchen
            type) affected more than 350,000 people in 2012, according to the
            Consumer Product Safety Commission. Dull knives are actually more
            dangerous than sharp ones, because they require more pressure to use
            and their worn edge can cause the knife to slip off food and into
            your fingers.

          <h3>Contact Burns From Equipment</h3>
          <p>
            The oven is magic. No longer do we have to sear our food on an open
            fire like our ancestors did; we have a nifty box that keeps the heat
            contained and cooks our food to perfection. But all that heat
            combined with metal components and cookware leads to loads of burns.
            Quick tips (which are obvious, but good to keep in mind): Always use
            oven mitts, replace them when theyre old; dont use a wet towel as an
            oven mitt; dont reach your arm in to check baked goods, pull out the
            rack to test;

          <h3>Microwave oven burns</h3>
          <p>
            More than 10,000 people were hurt using microwaves. Burns were most
            common.

          <p><h3>Cooking fires</h3>
            Fires involving cooking equipment account for two of every five
            reported home fires. Unattended cooking equipment accounts for one
            in three fires, and half are ignited by fat, grease, oil, or related
            substances, according to the National Fire Protection Association.

            <h3>Death to the Pathogens</h3>
            The most insidious of all dangers, perhaps, are the germs lurking in
            your food. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
            estimates that each year roughly one in six Americans (or 48 million
            people) gets sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die of
            foodborne diseases. The top five culprits sending Americans to the
            hospital are salmonella, norovirus, Campylobacter spp., Toxoplasma
            gondii and E.coli – but much can be done in terms of proper food
            handling, cooking and storage to help prevent these pathogens from
            causing illness.
